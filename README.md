Collection of UserScripts for use with Stack Exchange

## chatbuttons.user.js

This script adds custom buttons to the Stack Exchange chat. Clicking on the `buttons` button opens the settings menu from where you can manage your custom buttons.

## chatalerts.user.js

With this script, a list of words will be monitored in any opened room. If any of the words on your list shows up in the message, it will get a highlight and - if the setting is active and your browser supports the `audio` tag - will trigger the ping sound.

## timeline.user.js

Any question will receive a direct link to its post timeline when this script is installed. The `timeline` link will simply be appended to the normal post menu.

## posts.user.js

Similarly to `timeline.user.js`, this script simply adds a link to the revision history to every post that has not yet been edited.

## election.user.js

This script adds permanent links to the comments on the election page. Just like any other comment's link, the link is on the timestamp.
